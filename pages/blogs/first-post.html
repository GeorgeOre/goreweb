            <!-- Introduction -->
            This is my first blog post!
        </p>
        <h3>Section 1</h3>
        <p>
            <!-- Content for Section 1 -->
            I don't have anything in particular to write as of now. I am using this website simply as a side
            project. The most pragmatic part about this post is that it will serve as a template for future posts.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 2</h3>
        <p>
            <!-- Content for Section 2 -->
            For example, here I have created another section.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            <!-- Conclusion -->
            Later I will determine what sorts of thing I want to be publishing to this site. Until next time!
